# JobRepo
Repo for my ASP.Net site

This project was started recently. I wanted to create an web app that could help me keep track of all the jobs 
I was applying for and do some analytics on the data to tell my self some meaningfull things.
For example what city has the most c# roles. Right now it has simple bare bones CRUD functionality.
There is also a Widget page that just shows off some of my fundementals of programming

TODO
Plenty of exception and error handeling 
Responsive front end design
Partial Views

More analytics 
More widgets
